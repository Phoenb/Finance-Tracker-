Hi everyone!
What you see here is a Finance Tracker with the ability to analyze your finances and be able to make a report! Im working on adding some debugging components but so far its working nicely! To use this code,
youll use the main.ipynb file with the csv file. In notebook, you can do everything in one file! 
The other files I added were from when I was messing around and learning about the project! You can ignore those, I dont know how to get them off of git. 
Enjoy!
(This Project was taught to me through Code:You)
